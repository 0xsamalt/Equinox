# Equinox

<h4 align="center">
  A Decentralized Insurance Protocol
</h4>

Equinox is a comprehensive decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum, combining robust smart contracts with multiple frontend implementations and advanced risk assessment capabilities.

Built using:

- Smart Contracts: Solidity, Foundry
- Frontend: React/Vite, Next.js, TypeScript
- Risk Assessment: Rust
- Tools: Wagmi, Viem, RainbowKit

## Features

- **Smart Insurance Contracts**: Robust and auditable insurance policies powered by Solidity
- **Premium Management**: Advanced vault system for premium calculations and management
- **Oracle Integration**: Real-time data feeds for accurate risk assessment
- **Multiple Frontend Options**: Choose between Vite-based React or Next.js implementations
- **Risk Assessment Engine**: Powered by Rust for high-performance risk calculations
- **Secure Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with various wallet providers
- **Policy Management Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for managing insurance policies

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key packages:

### Foundry Package (`/packages/foundry`)

- Smart contract development and testing environment
- Core contracts including:
  - `Equinox.sol`: Main protocol contract
  - `PremiumVault.sol`: Insurance premium management
  - `Oracle.sol`: Price feed and data oracle
- Testing and deployment scripts

### Frontend Package (`/packages/frontend`)

- Modern React frontend built with Vite
- Features:
  - Policy management interface
  - Real-time premium calculations
  - Wallet integration
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Next.js Package (`/packages/nextjs`)

- Alternative frontend implementation using Next.js
- Includes:
  - Block explorer integration
  - Debug interface
  - Scaffold-ETH components
  - Web3 service integrations

### RiskZero Package (`/packages/riskZero`)

- Risk assessment and verification system
- Built wi![Uploading image.png…]()
th Rust
- Includes minimal verification contracts
